# Introduction to Linear Regression on Google Cloud

This project aims to predict the house price in different areas of the USA using a dataset that contains various features such as income, population, number of rooms, etc. The project involves data exploration, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, model evaluation and model deployment. The project uses Python and several libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The project demonstrates how to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem

Introduction:

The USA housing dataset is a collection of data about housing sales in different regions of the USA. 

The dataset contains the following columns:
Avg. Area Income: Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
Avg. Area House Age: Avg Age of Houses in same city
Avg. Area Number of Rooms: Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
Area Population: Population of city house is located in
Price: Price that the house sold at
Address: Address for the house

The dataset has 5000 rows and 7 columns, with 6 numerical features and 1 categorical feature (Address). The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict the price of a house based on the other features.
